# Heart-Attack-Prediction-Project_
Machine Learning project for predicting heart attacks using medical datasets.

Developed a comprehensive data analysis and machine learning project focused on predicting heart attacks using medical datasets.
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and extensive data preprocessing, including handling missing and negative values, to ensure data quality and integrity.
Utilized Python with key libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
Implemented and evaluated multiple machine learning classification algorithms: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, and Random Forest to identify predictive patterns within the dataset.
Gained practical experience in applying various modeling techniques to extract actionable insights from complex medical data.
